// const html = `<p>It\u2019s really amazing how much change actually goes on inside your uterus during the nine months that you\u2019re carrying Baby. From the moment sperm meets egg, Baby\u2019s adult eye color is predetermined by her genes. However, her gorgeous irises won\u2019t reach their big kid hue until she\u2019s at least nine months old, so you may get to see Baby with a radically different eye color than the one she will end up with!</p><h3>Eyes in your womb</h3><p>Once your egg is fertilized, Baby has a genetically predetermined eye color, even though she doesn\u2019t even have eyes yet! Her eyes will be fully formed around week 22, but she still won\u2019t have any pigmentation (color) in her iris until a bit later on, and it may not be her true color until at least nine months after birth, as the iris needs sunlight to stimulate melanin production.</p><p>Melanin is responsible for coloring the hair and eyes, and the more melanin there is, the darker the color. Blue eyes have the least amount of melanin, followed by green, then hazel, and then brown. Most Caucasian babies will have blue or steel-colored eyes following delivery, as there is not yet enough melanin built up to turn her eyes their true shade, while babies of African or Asian descent may have a darker eye color to begin with.</p>`;
